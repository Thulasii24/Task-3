TASKONE SQL PROJECT

Overview
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for managing and querying a relational database named TASKONE. It includes operations on three tables: STUDENT, DEPARTMENT, and MANUALS. The focus is on altering table structures, updating records, filtering data, and sorting results using standard SQL commands.

Database Name
TASKONE

Table Modification
Added a new column to the STUDENT table:
ALTER TABLE STUDENT ADD AGE INT NOT NULL

Data Updates
Updated the AGE value for individual and multiple students using the UPDATE statement and CASE expression.

Examples:
UPDATE STUDENT SET AGE = 21 WHERE STUDENT_ID = 1

UPDATE STUDENT SET AGE = CASE
WHEN STUDENT_ID = 2 THEN 22
WHEN STUDENT_ID = 3 THEN 20
WHEN STUDENT_ID = 4 THEN 25
WHEN STUDENT_ID = 5 THEN 21
WHEN STUDENT_ID = 6 THEN 23
WHEN STUDENT_ID = 7 THEN 20
WHEN STUDENT_ID = 8 THEN 21
WHEN STUDENT_ID = 9 THEN 24
WHEN STUDENT_ID = 10 THEN 22
END
WHERE STUDENT_ID IN 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Data Retrieval
Queries to select specific columns or all data from each table:

STUDENT Table
SELECT * FROM STUDENT
SELECT STUDENT_NAME FROM STUDENT
SELECT AGE FROM STUDENT
SELECT EMAIL_ID FROM STUDENT

DEPARTMENT Table
SELECT * FROM DEPARTMENT
SELECT DEPT_NAME FROM DEPARTMENT

MANUALS Table
SELECT * FROM MANUALS
SELECT MANUAL_NAME FROM MANUALS
SELECT PUBLISHED_YEAR FROM MANUALS

Filtering with WHERE Clause
SELECT STUDENT_NAME AGE FROM STUDENT WHERE AGE > 22
SELECT MANUAL_NAME MANUAL_PRICE FROM MANUALS WHERE MANUAL_PRICE > 500
SELECT PUBLISHED_YEAR FROM MANUALS WHERE PUBLISHED_YEAR > 2022

Sorting with ORDER BY
SELECT STUDENT_NAME AGE FROM STUDENT ORDER BY AGE
SELECT STUDENT_NAME AGE FROM STUDENT ORDER BY AGE ASC
SELECT STUDENT_NAME AGE FROM STUDENT ORDER BY AGE DESC
SELECT STUDENT_NAME AGE FROM STUDENT ORDER BY AGE LIMIT 3

SELECT MANUAL_NAME FROM MANUALS LIMIT 3
SELECT MANUAL_NAME PUBLISHED_YEAR FROM MANUALS ORDER BY PUBLISHED_YEAR LIMIT 5

SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID DEPT_NAME FROM DEPARTMENT ORDER BY DEPT_NAME
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID DEPT_NAME FROM DEPARTMENT ORDER BY DEPT_NAME LIMIT 5

Logical Operators
Using AND
SELECT * FROM STUDENT WHERE AGE > 20 AND GENDER = 'M'

Using OR
SELECT * FROM STUDENT WHERE AGE > 20 OR GENDER = 'M'

Using LIKE
SELECT * FROM DEPARTMENT WHERE DEPT_NAME LIKE A

Using BETWEEN
SELECT STUDENT_NAME AGE FROM STUDENT WHERE AGE BETWEEN 21 AND 25

Conclusion
This project covers the fundamentals of SQL including table modification, data update, filtering, sorting, and the use of logical operators. It is a useful reference for academic exercises and beginner-level SQL practice.
